# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

## Project Overview

This Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is an interactive web application that allows users to explore and understand different sorting algorithms through real-time visualization. The project provides a comprehensive tool for learning and comparing various sorting techniques.

## Features

### Sorting Algorithms
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort

### Visualization Capabilities
- Real-time sorting animation
- Customizable array size
- Adjustable sorting speed
- Visual representation of algorithm steps
- Performance metrics tracking

## Performance Metrics

The visualizer tracks:
- Number of comparisons
- Number of array accesses
- Sorting time

## How to Use

1. **Select Algorithm**: Choose from the dropdown menu
2. **Adjust Array Size**: Use the slider to change the number of elements
3. **Control Speed**: Select visualization speed
4. **Generate Array**: 
   - Click "Generate New Array" for random array
   - Use "Enter Custom Array" to input your own numbers
5. **Start Sorting**: Click "Start Sorting"
6. **Stop/Reset**: Use "Stop Sorting" or "Generate New Array" buttons

## Algorithm Information

Each algorithm comes with detailed information about:
- Description
- Time Complexity
- Space Complexity

## Technical Details

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Visualization**: HTML5 Canvas
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implemented as generator functions
- **Interactivity**: Vanilla JavaScript
